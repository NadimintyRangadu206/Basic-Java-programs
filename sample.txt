This tutorial introduces how to convert char array to int in Java 
and lists some example codes to understand the topic.
An array is a container that stores elements of the same data type. 
For example, an integer array can have only integer type values. 
An array that contains char values will be called a char array.
In this article, we will use several built-in methods such as 
parseInt(), valueOf(), String(), etc
that we will find a value in the given array.
